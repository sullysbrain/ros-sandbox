# ROS (Robotic Operating System) Sandbox Project

This is a sandboxed project folder for my work with ROS (the robotic operating system). Note, any references are to assume this is ROS2 and not ROS1 for dev purposes. The work done in the dev sandbox will eventually be used in the production repository for Project Samson.

## General Setup
The environment is being setup in Ubuntu 22.04 in a virtual machine on an M3 Max. I will be following this tutorial at least in the beginning:

This video goes through the installation of ROS2 on Ubuntu.
